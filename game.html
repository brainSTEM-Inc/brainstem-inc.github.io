    <h1>Continue the Phrase</h1>
    <p>A simple linguistics game that can be played by yourself, with friends, or with a computer (coming soon).</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Start with a suitable word.</li>
      <li>Continue the phrase by adding exactly one word that shares its leading characters with the previous word's trailing characters. They should have at least 3 characters in common.</li>
      <li>Another way to continue the phrase is to recyle the entire word and add another word that is a two-word phrase when combined with the previous word (or three-word phrase if the previous two words are disjoint). This can be the name of a person, movie, software, etc.</li>
      <li>The objective of the game is to continue the phrase for as long as possible.</li>
      <li>If the goal is n rounds (where each round consists of each player taking exactly one turn), each player gets n*0.2 (rounded down) "edits".</li>
      <li>The player who uses the edit may change exactly one character anywhere in the entire phrase (typically in the previous player's word) to any other character and play their turn using the new phrase. You CANNOT delete a character, and you must add at least one character after editing. Play continues using the new phrase.</li>
      <li>The game is cooperative, such that a player may choose a simpler word so that the next player can continue the phrase.</li>
      <li>To make the game more competitive, however, one can utilize a point system where the number of points each player gains on their turn is the number of characters they recycle from the previous player(s)'s word(s).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Specifics</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Words can be common names (at least one very famous person with that name).</li>
      <li>No need for hyphens, apostrophes, etc.</li>
      <li>Don't add actual numbers (123) unless the next player can pull it off with a phrase that contains those numbers. The three character rule still applies here.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Example with one player, 15 rounds (3 edits):</p>

        <td>Starting phrase.</td>
        <td>Change "e" to "i", add tardigrad.e</td>
        <td>Add grademelon, an amazing grade-checking application.</td>
        <td>Add melonin.</td>
        <td>Add ninjas. This would be a nice play in a multiplayer game since if you did just ninja, the next person would play ninjas and get 5 easy points.</td>
        <td>Add jasper, a common name, AI, and silica.</td>
        <td>Add aspergers. Note that you can't add aspergersyndrome since you need a full word to work off of when adding a phrase.</td>
        <td>Add ersatz. A decent vocab is...um decent to have.</td>
        <td>Edit 2! Quickly recover from the previous play by changing "z" to "o". Add atomic (not a great play if you're doing multiplayer!).</td>
        <td>Add bomb. Any random combination of adjective-noun might not be though...</td>
        <td>Add bombastic.</td>
        <td>Add tac. It's nice to help the next player, especially when it's you!</td>
        <td>Add toe. (You don't always have to be special :)</td>
        <td>Edit 3: Change "o" to "i" and add tied. Of course you CAN be special! :D</td>
        <td>Add tied off, tying off the phrase. Wait...</td>
