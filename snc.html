    <p class="comiccaption">Invented for a "Rhyme without Reason" spirit day at school alongside "Pi Die", where I was supposed to be Sir Cumference and my friend some manner of death. Ironically, I fell gravely ill that day and ended up not going to school, thus fulfilling the "die" part instead.</p>
